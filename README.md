This example demonstrates a subtle type error in TypeScript that might not be immediately apparent.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, the call to `add(5, "10")` passes a string as the second argument.  While this will lead to a runtime error, TypeScript's type checking does not catch this error at compile time. This is because TypeScript's type system does not perform extensive runtime checks to catch these errors and relies mainly on static analysis during compilation.  The solution demonstrates how to improve type safety using type guards or more robust type checking.
